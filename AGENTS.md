# UI/UX Build Standards

Always build interfaces with consistency, restraint, and strong visual hierarchy.

## Primary objective
Create modern, clean, production-ready UI that does not look generic or obviously AI-generated.

## Core rules
- Use a consistent spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48
- Prefer clear structure and hierarchy before decoration
- Avoid nested cards unless absolutely necessary
- Avoid thick borders, heavy shadows, and visual clutter
- Avoid pure black for large UI surfaces or text unless needed
- Keep layouts clean, balanced, and intentional
- Use typography to create hierarchy, not random font-size changes
- Use consistent border radius across components
- Use restrained colors and avoid over-designing
- Prioritize usability, readability, and alignment

## Layout rules
- Start with layout and spacing first
- Group related content clearly
- Use whitespace deliberately
- Do not overfill sections
- Prefer simple sections over too many containers
- Maintain consistent horizontal and vertical rhythm

## Typography rules
- Keep a clear hierarchy:
  - Heading
  - Subheading
  - Body
  - Supporting text
- Avoid weak contrast between text and background
- Avoid too many font sizes on one screen
- Headings should feel intentional and confident
- Body text should remain readable and calm

## Component rules
### Buttons
- Keep button sizing consistent
- Primary buttons should be visually clear
- Secondary buttons should not compete with primary actions
- Hover, focus, and disabled states must be designed

### Inputs
- Use clear labels
- Maintain good padding and focus states
- Inputs should feel calm and easy to scan

### Cards
- Prefer one clean container over many layered boxes
- Use subtle borders or very soft shadows only when needed
- Card content should have internal hierarchy and spacing

### Tables and lists
- Prioritize readability
- Use alignment and spacing to reduce noise
- Keep actions obvious but not visually loud

## UX rules
- Every screen should make the next action obvious
- Reduce friction and unnecessary decisions
- Prefer clarity over decoration
- Do not sacrifice usability for visual effects
- Design for real users, not just visual appeal

## Workflow
When generating UI, follow this order:
1. Establish layout and hierarchy
2. Apply spacing system
3. Refine typography
4. Style components cleanly
5. Add subtle polish only where useful
6. Review accessibility and interaction states

## Skill usage
- Use UI Skills during structure, layout, and review
- Use Interface Design memory/system rules for consistency
- Use Emil Kowalski’s skill for final polish, micro-interactions, and refinement
- Do not let polish change the established structure unnecessarily

## Anti-patterns to avoid
- Random padding and margin values
- Overuse of cards
- Overuse of gray-on-colored backgrounds
- Weak text contrast
- Thick borders everywhere
- Too many shadows
- Inconsistent radii
- Over-animated interfaces
- Template-looking SaaS blocks with no hierarchy

## Prompt behavior
When asked to build a UI:
- First produce a strong structural layout
- Then refine spacing and hierarchy
- Then polish details
- Keep output clean, modern, and intentional



## Additional visual constraints

### Spacing density
- Keep spacing tight and efficient, especially in dock-style UI and compact interface areas
- Prefer minimal padding over oversized containers
- Reduce unnecessary gaps between related actions and items
- Use small, controlled spacing that still preserves readability
- Default to compact layouts unless the content clearly needs more room

### Border radius
- Keep border radius minimal across the interface
- Prefer a mostly rectangular appearance
- Use very small rounding only where needed
- Standard radius should stay around 3px
- Avoid overly soft, pill-shaped, or heavily rounded components

### Color usage
- Use normal, grounded, professional colors
- Avoid trendy “AI-looking” palettes that feel synthetic or over-styled
- Prefer clean neutrals and believable accent colors
- Keep contrast strong enough for readability without making the UI harsh
- Use color intentionally, not decoratively

### Visual style restrictions
- Do not use glassmorphism
- Avoid blurred translucent panels, frosted backgrounds, and excessive transparency
- Avoid flashy gradient-heavy surfaces unless explicitly requested
- Keep surfaces solid, clear, and practical
- Favor clean, stable, production-style UI over experimental styling

### Component feel
- Buttons, inputs, cards, tables, sidebars, docks, and panels should feel compact and controlled
- Minimize internal padding where possible without hurting usability
- Avoid bulky containers
- Keep the interface sharp, structured, and efficient

# Deployment & Environment Configuration

## Branch → Environment Mapping

| Branch | Environment | App Name | Identifier |
|--------|------------|----------|------------|
| `develop` | `development` | Test MCE | `com.makechurcheasy.desktop.test` |
| `main` | `production` | MakeChurchEasy | `com.makechurcheasy.desktop` |

## GitHub Environments

Two GitHub Environments exist:
- **`development`** — used by `deploy-develop.yml` for pushes to `develop`
- **`production`** — used by `deploy-main.yml` for pushes to `main`, with approval gate

## Per-Project Env Files

Each project uses its framework's env convention:

| Project | Var Prefix | Framework |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `desktop/` | `VITE_APP_ENV` | Vite / Tauri |
| `api/` | `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` | Next.js (server) |
| `dashboard/` | `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` | Next.js (client) |
| `bible_backend/` | `APP_ENV` | Fastify / Hono |

Each project has:
- `.env` — development defaults (committed, no secrets)
- `.env.production` — production config (committed, placeholder secrets)
- `.env.example` — documented template

## Env Config Validation

`desktop/src/services/envConfig.ts` validates env vars at build time:
- In `production` mode (VITE_APP_ENV=production), missing required vars throw errors
- In `development` mode, missing vars get fallback defaults

## Workflow

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ci.yml` | PR to develop/main, push to develop/main | TypeScript check + build (desktop), Windows installer build |
| `deploy-develop.yml` | Push to develop | Build desktop (development) with dev env vars |
| `deploy-main.yml` | Push to main | Build desktop (production) with prod env vars, approval gate |
| `release.yml` | Tag `v*` | Build + publish signed installers for all platforms |
| `auto-tag.yml` | Push `package.json` change to main | Auto-creates version tag, triggers release |

## Tauri Identity

Before building, `scripts/build-env-config.mjs` rewrites `tauri.conf.json`:
- Uses `com.makechurcheasy.desktop.test` identifier for dev builds
- Uses `com.makechurcheasy.desktop` identifier for prod builds
- Updates app display name to "Test MCE" or "MakeChurchEasy"

## Secrets

All secrets live in GitHub Environments — never in committed files.
- `development` environment: secrets for dev/test (DEV_AUTH_API_URL, etc.)
- `production` environment: secrets for production (PROD_AUTH_API_URL, etc.)
- Fallback to repo-level secrets (`VITE_AUTH_API_URL`, etc.) if env-specific secret is not set
